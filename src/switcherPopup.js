/**
 * On-screen indicator for virtual workspace switches.
 *
 * GNOME shows a small pill with one dot per workspace whenever you switch, and
 * that feedback is precisely what virtual workspaces lack. The panel indicator
 * lives on the primary monitor, so switching a *secondary* monitor means the
 * confirmation appears on a different screen than the one that just changed —
 * you look away from the thing you were looking at.
 *
 * The shell's own popup cannot be reused. WorkspaceSwitcherPopup branches on
 * the very setting this extension requires:
 *
 *     if (Meta.prefs_get_workspaces_only_on_primary())
 *         constraint = new Layout.MonitorConstraint({primary: true});
 *
 * so with the setting on it builds exactly one popup, pinned to the primary
 * monitor — it will never appear where we need it. Its dot count also comes
 * straight from `global.workspace_manager.n_workspaces`, which has nothing to
 * do with our virtual count.
 *
 * What *is* reused is the appearance: `workspace-switcher` and
 * `ws-switcher-indicator` are style classes the shell theme already defines
 * (pill background, dot sizing, `:active` for the current one, the 4em lift off
 * the bottom edge). Borrowing them keeps this identical to the native OSD
 * without shipping a copy of its CSS, and it degrades well — a theme that drops
 * them renders an unstyled popup instead of throwing, which would not be true
 * of reaching into the shell's private actor fields.
 *
 * One popup per monitor, kept alive and reused rather than destroyed on
 * timeout the way the shell does. The shell can afford to destroy because
 * windowManager recreates on demand; here, keeping them removes the only real
 * hazard — a fade-out completing into a destroy while a second switch is
 * already reusing the actor.
